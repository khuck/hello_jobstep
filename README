Things to check:
    - Get assigned hardware
        - process binding
        - gpu binding
            - is it optimal? without "closest" it may not be. can we get that from lstopo?
        - openmp thread binding
    - Get thread counts
        - other threads
    - Get utilization
        - per bound set of resources
    - Get contention (nonvoluntary_ctx_switch)
        - for whole process
        - can get per thread?
    - Memory usage
        - % of total

    - check this all over time

Notes:
    - Don't want to pin progress threads. Need to identify the origin of the threads.
      MPI, HIP, CUDA threads should be allowed to float within their resource set.
